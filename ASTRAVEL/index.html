                                Central Park is an urban park in New York City located between the Upper West and Upper East Sides of Manhattan. It is the fifth-largest park in the city, covering 843 acres (341 ha). It is the most visited urban park in the United States, with an estimated 42 million visitors annually as of 2016, and is the most filmed location in the world.

                                    Central Park is split into three sections: the "North End" extending above the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir; "Mid-Park", between the reservoir to the north and the Lake and Conservatory Water to the south; and "South End" below the Lake and Conservatory Water. It has eight lakes and ponds that were created artificially by damming natural seeps.

    <i> By: Keith Raganas <p>
It is one of the must-sees on a trip to New York City. (It's also a wonderful location for NYC photography!) Locals love Central Park as it is an oasis away from the hustle and bustle of life in NYC. With so many people and things to do, Central Park is very safe during the daytime.</p></i>
<i>By: John Paul Yongco<p>I would def stay closer to Times Square. It is very lively at night and you can feel the atmosphere of the city. It is handy for evening meals and things to do at night i.e theatres, bars. It is a lot quieter up near central park.</p></i>
<i>By: John lloyd Siarot<p>Love this place. It’s the park to escape the cars, people and big buildings. Never went to the zoo, we walked all round it and just enjoyed it. Would not even think of the horse carriages, those wee souls look like they need set free to a ranch!</p></i>
